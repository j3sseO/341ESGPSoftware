# Encost Smart Graph Project (ESGP)

## Overview

The Encost Smart Graph Project (ESGP) is a software system developed for Encost, a smart home development company. ESGP enables the visualization of Encostâ€™s smart devices using a graph data structure. This project was undertaken as part of a software engineering course at the University of Waikato, and it involved multiple phases including design, testing, construction, and maintenance + DevOps.

## Project Description

The ESGP project was divided into three main phases:

1. **Design Phase:** Creation of a comprehensive Software Design Specification (SDS) document detailing the system architecture, component interactions, and design decisions.
2. **Testing Phase:** Development of a Functional Software Test Plan and implementation of unit tests using JUnit to ensure the system meets specified requirements.
3. **Construction Phase:** Implementation of the ESGP software based on the SDS and Test Plan, following SCRUM methodology for planning and execution.
4. **Maintenance and DevOps Phase:** Completed

## Current State
The ESGP project currently only supports visualising a graph representation of the data, as this was all that was expected for COMPX341. Further additions may be made in the future.

## Running The Software
(In Windows) Run the following command in a Command Prompt window within the EncostSmartGraphProject folder.
```bash
java -cp "lib\gs-core-2.0.jar";"lib\gs-ui-swing-2.0.jar" Backend.java
```
